    secondAboutMeText: `I was born in 2001, in a rather small city, having developed a
    strong passion for videogames from a young age. As time passed, technology and computers
    started growing on me more and more, which led to the decision of attending a Computer Science
    oriented high school in my city. Four years later, I was going into my first days as a Computer
    Science student in Greenwich, London. I spent my time there learning more about programming and
    general computer science, as well as refined my already-existing skills, walking amongst inspiring
    young classmates, from whom I have taken many lessons and improved my knowledge.`,
